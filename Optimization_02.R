#Constraints Optimazations 
#Unconstraint Optimization : No boundries or soft Boundaries
#Constraint Optimaxation : hard limit placed on value of decision variable that might lead to choose or eliminate certian direction
 
#Equality constraints
#Langrage Multipliers :
# 1. It is a technique used in optimization problems that involve constraints
# 2. For the objective function f(x,y) with constraint function g(x,y)
# grad f(x,y)=-lambda grad g(x,y)
#multivariate  inequality constraints optimization
#constraints of type >= or <= 
# lagrangian 
# L(x1,x2...,u1,u2...)=equation +u(f<=0)+...
# first oder KKT conditions 
# u(f(x))=0
# n euation for with derivative wrt to each variable =0
#ui>=0
